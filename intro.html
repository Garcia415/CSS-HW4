    <h1>Homework 4</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://garcia415.github.io/CSS-HW4/" target="_blank">Part 1</a>- Open the hw4.html, take a look at the page in the browser and take a look at the code. You will modify the code, still using grids, in order to have the final result as you see in the image hw4final.png. Once you finish your code save it as hw4part1.html, upload it to the server and remember to update the assignment web page of your homework 1 to point to Homework 4 - Part 1 (hw4part1.html)
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://garcia415.github.io/CSS-HW4/grid.html" target="_blank">Part 2</a>- Take a look at the image hw4flexboxfinal.png. You should code a web page, using the flexbox you have learned to produce a page as you see in that image. Save that page as hw4part2.html, upload it to the server and update also the assignment web page of your homework 1 to link to that file - with a link such as Homework 4 - Part 2.</li>
        <li><a href="https://garcia415.github.io/CSS-HW4/fairy.html" target="_blank">Part 3</a>- You will use the fairytale.html file and modify the code so that it will be formatted as shown in the image below - notice that in this image, you have the WHOLE entire content within 4 columns but the footer content is still centralized within the footer area!</li>
    </ul>
